PROBLEM:
The diagram below depicts our assembled Sample Input:

variable-length-arrays.png

We perform the following  queries:

Find the array located at index , which corresponds to . We must print the value at index  of this array which, as you can see, is .
Find the array located at index , which corresponds to . We must print the value at index  of this array which, as you can see, is .

SOLUTION:
  //DEFINES TWO INTEGERSZ
    int n;
    int q;
    //TAKES IN THE INTEGERS FROM VALUES
    cin >> n >> q;
    //SETS UP A VECTOR TO THE SIZE OF VALUES
    vector<int> a[n];
    //LOOPS TO GET THE VALUE OF THE SECOND 
    for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
        int m;
        cin >> m;
        int o;
        for(int j = 0; j < m; j++){
            cin >> o;
            a[i].push_back(o);
        }
    }
    
    int r, s;
    for(int k = 1; k <= q; k++){
        cin >> r >> s;
        cout << a[r][s] << endl;
    }
